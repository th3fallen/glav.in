Glav.in
=======

The goal of Glav.in is to provide the simplest CMS experience possible. It is **not** intended for large, multifaceted websites - it just ain't got the juice. Glav.in is for simple, informational websites. Maybe a site for a local barber shop? Perhaps even a site for your cat?

Features
========

* Super simple to install.
* Open Source
* No database. All of the pages are stored in json files.
* It's named after a catchphrase of a character from The Simpsons.

Non-Features
============

* It's not powerful, at the moment all you can do is create and edit pages.
* It's not robust. There aren't any plug-ins or widgets.

Requirements
============

* Apache
* PHP 5.2+


Contribute!
===========
